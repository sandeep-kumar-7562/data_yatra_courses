# 📘  Python Dictionaries

A **Python dictionary** is a data structure that stores the value in **key: value** pairs.  
- **Values** in a dictionary can be of any data type and can be **duplicated**.  
- **Keys** can't be repeated and must be **immutable**.

Dictionaries are widely used for **fast data lookup**, **data mapping**, and **structured data representation**.



## 🔑 Key Characteristics
- Each key must be **unique**.
- Dictionary values can be of any data type.
- Dictionaries are mutable, so you can update, add, or remove items.
- Represented with **curly braces `{}`** and key-value pairs separated by a colon `:`.
