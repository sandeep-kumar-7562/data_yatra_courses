git # 🔁 Looping Through Lists in Python

Looping through lists allows you to access and manipulate each item stored in a list. Python provides several ways to loop through lists.

---

## 📘 Using a `for` Loop
The most common way to loop through a list is by using a `for` loop.

> Example

>```python
>fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
>
>for fruit in fruits:
>    print(fruit)
>```

**Output**

>```
>apple
>banana
>cherry
>```

## 🔢 Using `for` Loop with `range()`
Sometimes, you need the index as well. Use `range()` with `len()`:

> Example

>```python
>fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
>
>for i in range(len(fruits)):
>    print(i, fruits[i])
>```

**Output**

>```
>0 apple
>1 banana
>2 cherry
>```

## 🔁 Using a `while` Loop

You can also loop through a list using a `while` loop.

> Example

>```python
>fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
>
>i = 0
>while i < len(fruits):
>    print(fruits[i])
>    i += 1
>```

**Output**

>```
>apple
>banana
>cherry
>```

## 💡 Looping with List Comprehension

List comprehension can also be used to loop and perform operations in a single line:

> Example

>```python
>fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
>
>[print(fruit) for fruit in fruits]
>```

**Output**

>```
>apple
>banana
>cherry
>```
