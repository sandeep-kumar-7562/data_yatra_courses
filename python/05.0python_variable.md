# 📘 Python Variables

## 🧩 What is a Variable?

A **variable** is a name that stores a value in a program. It acts like a container that holds information such as numbers, text, or other types of data. In Python, you don’t need to declare the type of a variable — Python figures it out automatically.



## 🎯 Key Features of Python Variables

- No need to declare the type
- Easy to create and use
- The value can be changed anytime
- Variable names must begin with a letter or underscore

>print(x)
