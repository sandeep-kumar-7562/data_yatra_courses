# 🛠️ Chapter 2: Installing Python and Setting Up the Environment

## 🧩 Getting Started
Before you start writing Python code, you need to install Python on your system and set up a suitable development environment. This chapter will guide you through the process step by step

### 🔽 Installing Python

1. **Visit the official website:**  
   [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. **Download the latest version** compatible with your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

3. **Install Python:**
   - On **Windows**, make sure to check the box that says **“Add Python to PATH”** before clicking "Install Now".
   - On **macOS/Linux**, Python might already be installed. You can verify by running:
     ```bash
     python3 --version
     ```

4. **Verify the installation** by opening your terminal or command prompt and typing:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

## 💡 Python IDEs and Editors
While you can write Python code in any text editor, using an IDE makes coding easier and more productive.

#### Recommended Options:
- VS Code (lightweight, fast, with extensions for Python)
- PyCharm (feature-rich, great for large projects)
- Jupyter Notebook (ideal for data science and visualization tasks)

## 🔧 Installing VS Code in window 
1. Download from: https://code.visualstudio.com/

2. Install the Python extension by Microsoft from the Extensions panel.

3. Select the Python interpreter from the Command Palette (Ctrl + Shift + P) → “Python: Select Interpreter”

## ✅ Testing Your Setup
