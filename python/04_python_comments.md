# 📝 Python Comments

## 💡 What Are Comments in Python?
Comments are lines in Python code that are not executed. They are used to explain the code and make it more readable. Python ignores comments during execution.



## 🧠 Why Use Comments?
- To explain code logic.
- To make the code more readable.
- To temporarily disable code.

## 🟩 Single Line Comment

A single-line comment starts with a `#` symbol.

>Example

>```python
># This is a comment
>print("Hello, World!")  # This is also a comment
>```
## 🟨 Multi-line Comments in Python

Python does not have a dedicated syntax for multi-line comments. However, there are two commonly used ways to write them.



### 🔹 1. Using Multiple `#` Symbols

Use a `#` at the beginning of each line to write multi-line comments.

>Example

>```python
># This is a multi-line comment
># explaining a block of code
># line by line using hash symbols
>print("Hello, World!")
>```

### 🔹 2. Using Triple Quotes (''' or """)
Triple-quoted strings (single or double quotes) can be used as multi-line comments, as long as they are not assigned to a variable.

>Example

> ```python
>"""
>This is a string
>that acts like a comment
>when not assigned.
>"""
>print("Python is awesome!")
>```
**OR**
> ```python
>'''
>Another way to write
>multi-line comments
>using single quotes.
>'''
>print("Python is simple!")
>```
