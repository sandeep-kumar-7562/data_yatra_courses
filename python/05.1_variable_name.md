# 🏷️ Variable Names in  python

A **variable name** is the name you give to a variable so you can refer to the stored value later in your code. Choosing a clear and valid variable name is important for writing readable and error-free programs.

## ✅ Rules for Naming Variables:

**✅ Allowed:**

- Must start with a letter (a–z, A–Z) or an underscore `_`

- Cannot start with a number `(0-9)`

- Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores

- Case-sensitive (`name` and `Name` are different)


**❌ Not Allowed:**

- Starting with a number (e.g., `2value`)
- Special characters (`@`, `#`, `%`, etc.)
- Using Python keywords (like `if`, `while`, `def`)

> Example

> ✅ **valid variable name:**
>```python
>value = 50
>my_name = "Raj"
>_class = "Math"
>user1 = "Anjali"
>```

> 🚫 Invalid Variable Names:
>```python
>2value = 50       # ❌ Starts with a number
>my-name = "Raj"   # ❌ Hyphens not allowed
>class = "Math"    # ❌ 'class' is a keyword
>```

## 🧾 Multi-word Variable Names in Python

In Python, when a variable name contains **more than one word**, you should follow a naming convention to keep your code clean and readable.
___

Python developers usually follow the **snake_case** style, where words are separated by underscores `_` .

> Example
>```python
>student_name = "Ravi"
>total_marks = 480
>is_logged_in = True
>```
