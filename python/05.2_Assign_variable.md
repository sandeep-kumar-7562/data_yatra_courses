# 📝 Assigning Values to Variables

### 📌 Basic Assignment

In Python, **basic assignment** means assigning a value to a variable using the `=` operator.

> Example

>```python
>x = 10
>y=  4.5
>z=  "john"
>```
### 🔄 Dynamic Typing

In Python, **dynamic typing** means you don't need to declare the data type of a variable.  
The type is decided automatically when the value is assigned, and it can change during execution.

> Example

>```python
>x = 10         # x is an integer
>x = "Hello"    # now x is a string
>print(x)
>```

**Output**

>```
>   Hello
>```

### 🧮 Multiple Assignments
___
Python allows multiple variables to be assigned values in a single line.

### Many Values to Multiple Variables
Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line.

>Example

>```python
>x, y, z= 5, 3.5, "python"
>print(x)
>print(y)
>print(z)
>```

**Output**

>```
> 5
> 3.5
> python
>```
### 📦 One Value to Multiple Variables

Assign the same value to multiple variables in a single line.

> Example

>```python
>a = b = c = 50
>print(x)
>print(y)
>print(z)
>```

**Output**

>```
> 50
> 50
> 50
>```
### 📤 Unpack a Collection

Python allows you to extract values from a list, tuple, or other collection and assign them to variables in a single line.

> Example

>```python
>fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
>
>x, y, z = fruits
>print(x)
>print(y)
>print(z)
>```

**Output**

>```
> apple
> banana
> cherry
